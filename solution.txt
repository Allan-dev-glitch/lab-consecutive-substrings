Please add your pseudocode to this file
And a written explanation of your solutionSolution Description:
This function, consecutiveSubstrings, generates all consecutive substrings of an input string.
It loops through each character as a starting point, and then builds substrings by adding one character
at a time until the end of the string. Each substring is added to a result array, which is returned
at the end.

Example:
Input: "abc"
Output: ["a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"]

Time Complexity: O(n^2) 
- The outer loop runs n times, and the inner loop runs up to n times for each iteration.
- Therefore, the total operations grow quadratically with the length of the input string.

Space Complexity: O(n^2)
- We store all consecutive substrings in an array.
- The number of substrings is roughly n*(n+1)/2, which is quadratic.
